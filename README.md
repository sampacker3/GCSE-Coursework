# Wi-Fi-Enabled-RFID-Arduino-Safe


// Code By Samuel Packer; candidate 4118
// Fully completed using Arduino IDE in language of C++

// Code for the Arduino Uno featured in the safe prototype
// The code allows the user to first scan a key card, then enter a key code and if the 2 are correct then the safe will unlock by changing the servo angle of the locking bolts.
// Neopixel Ring by adafruit has been used aswell as an I2C LCD Dispay to communicate with the user telling them if the code/card is correct.
// Code can be uploaded to any Adruno based board using the ATMEGA328P chip as present on my Arduino UNO clone board.
